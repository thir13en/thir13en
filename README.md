### Hey bambino! ðŸ‘‹ Hi I am Santi
#### I am a tech lover, I believe technology can be used to improve our society as a whole.

I was not an early prodigy, even thou I always had a fascination with technology, I studied chemistry and worked in the pharmaceutical industry for a while, where I decided I needed more excitement in my life and I joined the path of being a developer. I really enjoy the challenges and the rush of constantly learning new things, but this is superfluous compared to the main reason I believe tech industry is my place. I feel we have the opportunity to shape society, and thus we have the huuuuge responsability of shaping it for the better. I am really keen on listening to your ideas, so feel welcome to my little space in GitHub.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working @ Dynatrace  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in the never ending path of mastering being a Full Stack Developer.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data visualization projects
